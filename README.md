# Homework 1: Semantic Tagging

## Overview

This is the first assignment completed for my U of M full-stack boot camp. In this project, I am asked to review and make revisions to an existing html document - relying on the knowledge I obtained from the cohort.

I met a few challenges but was able to overcome them by searching the interweb and consulting my peers. I'm very excited about the material I've learned thus far and look forward to increasing my knowledge base by utilizing the various resources provided through this program.

## Objective

Revise some existing HTML code to use semantic tags where appropriate
